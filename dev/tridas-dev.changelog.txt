- The typographical error in linkSeries attribute idRref has been changed to idRef 
- In element 'element' the child element 'sample' has been set to minOccurs=0 
- In element 'radius' the child element 'measurementSeries' has been set to minOccurs=0
- Added 'title' element to all entities to be used as a human readable identifier.  
- Renamed project.projectTitle to project.title for consistency
- Added radius.azimuth to record the angle in decimal degrees from true north that the radius is taken.
- Deleted derivedSeries.units
- Renamed element.function to element.type for consistency
- Added derivedSeries.linkSeries
- Deleted derivedSeries.usedSeries (replaced with derivedSeries.linkSeries)
- Added createdTimestamp to each entity
- Added lastModifiedTimestamp to each entity
- Made derivedSeries.standardizingMethod optional
- Synchronised the minOccurs and maxOccurs of all elements to coincide with the 'mandatory' and 'repeatable' fields in the documentation.
- Moved element.linkSeries below element.identifier in sequence for consistency
- Changed sample.samplingDate to optional. 
- Added derivedSeries.extentGeometry and derivedSeries.extentComment
- Added altitude, slopeAngle, slopeAzimuth, soilDescription, soilDepth and bedrockDescription to 'element'.
- Combined the note and stdRemark fields in 'value' to a single 'remark' field using specialised controlled vocabulary.  The possible values are: Fire damage; Frost damage; Crack; False ring(s); Compression wood; Tension wood; Traumatic ducts; Unspecified injury.
- Set minOccurs=0 and maxOccurs=unbounded in measurementSeries.values and derivedSeries.values
- radius.lastRingUnderBark made mandatory
- unit and variable has been moved into values-section
- Option has been introduced to have it unitless instead of a variable and unit
- Three types of date(time) are introduced: dateTime (xs:extension of xs:dateTime for timestamps) date (xs:extension of xs:date for where time is irrelevant) and year (xs:extension of xs:positiveInteger). The year has the attribute suffix, containing AD, BC or BP.  
- Attribute normalTridas has been introduced to all controlledVoc-typed elements. In this attribute the TRiDaS community can add a specific TRiDaS 
controlledVoc, that can be validated.
- complexType date extension base has been changed into xs:dateTime instead of xs:string.
- Renamed *Series.calendar to *Series.datingReference
- Added the count attribute to the value element for storing the number of measurementSeries values that contribute to a derivedSeries value.
- Removed unitsML namespace which is no longer required.
- Added list of acceptable variables for TRiDaS dictionary
- Added additional possible entries to TRiDaS units dictionary
- Renamed datingReference/usedSeries into linkSeries
